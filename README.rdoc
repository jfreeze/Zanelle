This project includes an Adhearsion app and a Sinatra webserver to control a phone system for a small office.


TODO: Add instructions for setup

If you wish to use Adhearsion to control Asterisk's dialplan,
change the contexts you wish to be affected in your
/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf file to the following:

[your_context_name]
exten => _X.,1,AGI(agi://1.2.3.4) ; This IP here
