h2. Determining Call Handler

Call handlers are members of a call hander group.

* Which CHG depends on call context and DNID.
* Which CH depends if CH selection is manual or automatic.
** If Manual, then just choose the active CH.
** If automatic, then System State determines which CH to use.
*** System State is based upon Time

Call Handlers may also have components that have state, such as doctor-on-call.

Can CH be shared across different CHG's? Do we copy or select CH for a CHG from a list of CH's.
